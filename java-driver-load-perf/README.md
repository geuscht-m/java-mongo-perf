# Demo code showing the interaction between document insertion and downstream queueing using a changestream

## TODO:

- Current test document filenames are hardcoded
- Number of document loader threads need to be configurable
- Number of sequence update threads need to be configurable
- Changestream code needs some experimental code to improve/work around performance as demo
